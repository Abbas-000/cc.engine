        certifies that, to the best of his knowledge, the work of

        A certifier has taken reasonable steps to verify the copyright

        certified is not in the public domain.

        Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public
        at large and to the detriment of the Dedicator's heirs and
        successors.  Dedicator intends this dedication to be an overt
        act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and future
        rights under copyright law, whether vested or contingent, in
        the Work. Dedicator understands that such relinquishment of
        all rights includes the relinquishment of all rights to
        enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those copyrights in the
        Work.

      <p>
        Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain,
        the Work may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted,
        used, modified, built upon, or otherwise exploited by anyone
