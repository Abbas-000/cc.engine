        Using the Public Domain Mark, you can mark a work that is free of
        known copyright restrictions and clearly convey that status.  When
        applied properly, the PDM allows the work to be easily discovered,
        and provides valuable information about the work.
      </p>

      <p i18n:translate="license.mark.intro_2">
        The PDM is intended for use with old works that are free of
        copyright restrictions around the world, or works that have been
        affirmatively placed in the worldwide public domain prior to the
        expiration of copyright by the rightsâ€™ holder.  It should not be
        used to mark works that are in the public domain in some
        jurisdictions while known to be restricted by copyright in
        others. Currently, Creative Commons does not recommend the Public
        Domain Mark for works whose copyright status differs jurisdiction
        to jurisdiction, though we are developing means for marking and
        tagging such works.  You should consult with your legal advisor if
        you are unsure whether you should use the PDM for a work you have
        identified.
      </p>

        Please note that this is <strong>not a registration
          process</strong> and Creative Commons does not store or save any
        of the information you provide. This tool guides you through the
        process of generating HTML with embedded metadata for marking the
        work you have identified as free of known copyright restrictions.
        The work will not be associated with a Public Domain Mark until
        you publish it marked as being so.
