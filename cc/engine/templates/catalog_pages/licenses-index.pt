            The Creative Commons copyright licenses and tools forge a balance
            inside the traditional “all rights reserved” setting that copyright
            law creates. Our tools give everyone from individual creators to
            large companies and institutions a simple, standardized way to grant
            copyright permissions to their creative work. The combination of our
            tools and our users is a

          <p i18n:translate="license.index.design_rationale.body1">
            All Creative Commons licenses have many important features in
            common. Every license helps creators &mdash; we call them licensors
            if they use our tools &mdash; retain copyright while allowing others
            to copy, distribute, and make some uses of their work &mdash; at
            least non-commercially. Every Creative Commons license also ensures
            licensors get the credit for their work they deserve. Every Creative
            Commons license works around the world and lasts as long as
            applicable copyright lasts (because they are built on
            copyright). These common features serve as the baseline, on top of
            which licensors can choose to grant additional permissions when
            deciding how they want their work to be used.
          </p>

          <p i18n:translate="license.index.design_rationale.body2">
            A Creative Commons licensor answers a few simple questions on the
            path to choosing a license &mdash; first, do I want to allow
            commercial use or not, and then second, do I want to allow
            derivative works or not? If a licensor decides to allow derivative
            works, she may also choose to require that anyone who uses the work
            &mdash; we call them licensees &mdash; to make that new work
            available under the same license terms. We call this idea
            “ShareAlike” and it is one of the mechanisms that (if chosen) helps
            the digital commons grow over time. ShareAlike is inspired by the
            GNU General Public License, used by many free and open source
            software projects.

            Our licenses do not affect freedoms that the law grants to users of
            creative works otherwise protected by copyright, such as exceptions
            and limitations to copyright law like fair dealing. Creative Commons
            licenses require licensees to get permission to do any of the things
            with a work that the law reserves exclusively to a licensor and that
            the license does not expressly allow. Licensees must credit the
            licensor, keep copyright notices intact on all copies of the work,
            and link to the license from copies of the work. Licensees cannot
            use technological measures to restrict access to the work by others.

              Our public copyright licenses incorporate a unique and innovative
              “three-layer” design. Each license begins as a traditional legal
              tool, in the kind of language and text formats that most lawyers
              know and love. We call this the Legal Code layer of each license.
            </p>

            <p i18n:translate="license.index.three_layers.body2">
              But since most creators, educators, and scientists are not in fact
              lawyers, we also make the licenses available in a format that
              normal people can read — the Commons Deed (also known as the
              “human readable” version of the license). The Commons Deed is a
              handy reference for licensors and licensees, summarizing and
              expressing some of the most important terms and conditions. Think
              of the Commons Deed as a user-friendly interface to the Legal Code
              beneath, although the Deed itself is not a license, and its
              contents are not part of the Legal Code itself.
            </p>

            <p i18n:translate="license.index.three_layers.body3">
              The final layer of the license design recognizes that software,
              from search engines to office productivity to music editing, plays
              an enormous role in the creation, copying, discovery, and
              distribution of works. In order to make it easy for the Web to
              know when a work is available under a Creative Commons license, we
              provide a “machine readable” version of the license — a summary of
              the key freedoms and obligations written into a format that
              software systems, search engines, and other kinds of technology can
              understand. We developed a standardized way to describe licenses
              that software can understand called
              <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Ccrel">CC Rights
                Expression Language</a> (CC REL) to accomplish this.

              is a core user of our licenses as well.

            <p i18n:translate="license.index.three_layers.body5">
              Taken together, these three layers of licenses ensure that the
              spectrum of rights isn’t just a legal concept. It’s something that
              the creators of works can understand, their users can understand,
              and even the Web itself can understand.
