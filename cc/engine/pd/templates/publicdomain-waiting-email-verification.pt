<h1>Public Domain Dedication - Email Confirmation</h1>
<p>An email has been sent to you at 
  <strong><span i18n:name="email" 
		tal:content="request/email" /></strong>. You should receive 
it within a few minutes.</p>

<p>This email includes a confirmation of your public domain dedication. 
It should include the title of your work 
("<b><span i18n:name="title" tal:content="request/title" /></b>"), 
and the copyright holder of the work
("<b><span i18n:name="copyright_holder" 
	    tal:content="request/copyright_holder" /></b>").</p>

<p>The email will also include a link with an embedded confirmation code. 
This confirmation code enables us to verify that you are indeed the person 
eligible to receive email at <b>${email}</b>. 
Clicking through on this confirmation link will constitute an "overt act of 
relinquishment" by which you will actually be placing your work in the 
public domain.</p>

<p><b>Until you click the confirmation link, your work will not be dedicated 
to the public domain.</b>
</p>

<p>If for some reason you haven't received this email within 30-45 minutes, 
please <a href="mailto:pd@creativecommons.org">let us know</a>.</p>

<p>After clicking on the confirmation link, you'll find out how to mark your 
content with a public domain dedication and publicize your work.</p>

    <h1>Public Domain Dedication - Bad Confirmation</h1>

    <p>It seems you are trying to confirm your public domain dedication 
      with an incorrect confirmation code.</p>

    <p>This probably happened because you were not able to click through 
      on the URL sent in your email, and you copy and pasted the URL 
      incorrectly into your browser. Make sure to include <b>all 
	characters</b> from the URL sent to you.</p>

    <p>If this is not what happened, or if you continue to have trouble 
      confirming your public domain dedication in any way, please 
      <a href="mailto:pd@creativecommons.org">let us know</a>.
