    <h1>Public Domain Dedication - Bad Confirmation</h1>

    <p>It seems you are trying to confirm your public domain dedication 
      with an incorrect confirmation code.</p>

    <p>This probably happened because you were not able to click through 
      on the URL sent in your email, and you copy and pasted the URL 
      incorrectly into your browser. Make sure to include <b>all 
	characters</b> from the URL sent to you.</p>

    <p>If this is not what happened, or if you continue to have trouble 
      confirming your public domain dedication in any way, please
